			<h2><a href="alimmoral.github.io/OCR/Home.html">OCR Conversion</a></h2>
			<p>
				What is OCR? OCR is "Optical Character Recognition", which is being able to detect text from image files. 
				What's the Problem? Offices and students need an application/solution to getting text from an image without having to type in word by word. This is time consuming and inconvenient for them if they have limited time to complete something that needs attention.
				Solution: As a Capstone project, me and my group decided to work on a Windows application and a website where users can get text from files. Users can get the converted text in either way: display on screen, .txt file, or PDF file.
