	  <p>Listed are the current projects I have completed or am currently working on:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><font size="5">ADit - Together We Hack Hackathon</li>
      <p>Theme: How can we use computer science and coding to better our world?"</p>
      <p>AT&T theme: How to target advertisements to the right group of people?</p>
      <p>I worked in a group for the AT&T theme where we focused on how to promote suitable advertisements for users. For our group, we decided to make a Google Chrome extension that filtered the type of advertisements, allowing users to view advertisements that would more loikely attract them and/or also save some advertisements they are interested in.</p>
	    <li><font size="5"><a href="../OCR/Home.html">OCR Conversion</a></font></li>
      <p> This is a website where users are allowed to get text from images. OCR means "Optical Character Recognition" which is where text is recognized on an image and is given to you in actual text, so you can save time without having to retype the text.</p>
