	  <p>Hi! My name is Anne and welcome to my Github website!</p>
	  <p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p>
	  <p>I am a graduate of Hunter College with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.
	  I am someone who loves traveling, photography, music, and is also a big fan of Japanese snacks. I also love to learn different languages, although not fluent, I memorize some to keep in handy (this does not exclude coding languages).</p>

	  <br>

	  <p><strong>How did you get into Computer Science?</strong></p>
	  <p>It all started... with Scratch</p>
	  <p>If you're not familiar with Scratch, it was an application, where you can animate things and maybe create a game out of. It consisted of code blocks that represented a certain action. It fascinated me with how it worked.</p>
	  <p>I first approached this in my freshman year of high school, now I didn't know any coding but the real fun didn't start until my junior year, where I was was enrolled to a Java course.</p>
	  <p>Coding became so fun for me that I would try to get my hands on any coding practice as much as I could while at school (including taking some of my teacher's worksheets for Advanced Placement Java)</p>

	  <br>

	  <p><strong>What is your dream job in the next 10 years?</strong></p>
	  <p>I want to pursue a career in the Computer Science, specifically software engineering. I do also have interest in Web development and also Android/IOS development for some time.</p>
