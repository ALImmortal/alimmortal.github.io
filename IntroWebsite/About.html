	  <p>I am Anne Liang and I am an senior at Hunter College. 
	  I am currently majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics.
	  Besides Math and Computer Science, I have interests in Web Development and Android App Development.
	  My hobbies include traveling, photography, music, cooking.</p>

	  <p>Besides Computer Science, I also have an interest in Education, tutoring 
	  students and learning the problems students have and how I should encounter and 
	  resolve them. I also currently work in the New York Interscholastic Mathematics 
	  League Executive Committee, interacting with high schools. During these four years 
	  in college, I hope to pursue my dreams in computer science while I improve my 
	  communication skills with students, teachers, and others who have the need to 
	  start a good conversation.</p>
