	  <p>Hi! My name is Anne and welcome to my Github website!</p>
	  <p><strong>Who are you?</strong></p>
	  <p>I am a graduate of Hunter College with a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science and a minor in Mathematics.
	  I am someone who loves traveling, photography, music, and is also a big fan of Japanese snacks. I also love to learn different languages, although not fluent, I memorize some to keep in handy (this does not exclude coding languages).</p>

	  <br>

	  <p><strong>How did you get into Computer Science?</strong></p>
	  <p>It starts from my junior year of high school when I got my hands on learning Java. I was currently in the Academy of Information Technology as I was interested in comptuters. I also was encourage by my teacher to attend coding bootcamps and programs involving coding, which is NYC Generation Tech and Technovation. After graduating high school, I wanted to follow the Computer Science path in college, which I proceeded at Hunter College. Since then, I would sometimes attend hackathons, some coding workshops at General Assembly, and maybe learn/review programming languages.</p>

	  <br>

	  <p><strong>What is your dream job in the next 5/10 years?</strong></p>
	  <p>I want to pursue a career in the Computer Science, specifically software engineering. I do also have interest in Web development and also Android/IOS development for some time.</p>
